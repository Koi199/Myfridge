Hack the Change 2022 - MyFridge
A first attempt at creating a web-based application to track food in your fridge to prevent wastage by setting reminders for automatically setting reminders for expiry dates and suggesting recipes based on the groceries that you have in your fridge. This idea was first conceptualised with three other teammates for a Hackathon organized by the University of Calgary.
